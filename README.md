## Word-Guess-Game
Description: A geography-themed word guess game.

Objective: Try to guess the country by typing in one letter at a time. If the letter is in the word, it is shown in the 'word to guess'. If the letter is not in the word, it is added to 'letters guessed' and the 'remaining guesses' count drops by one. The player has 10 guesses. If all guesses are used up, the player loses the round, the losses count goes up by one, and a new round begins. If the player guesses the correct country, the wins count goes up by one, a map of the country is shown, and a new round begins. 

Directions: Use the letter keys to guess letters in the word.
